#23: Cookies in a browser track the user's activities and collect information about them and what they are doing on the website. Therefore, having cookies exposed exposes the user the most. The IP of a user is used for routing packets and doesn't expose anything about the uesr really. An email address isn't private at all and is required for communication which is its purpose. The public key should actually be known and public if the user wants to receive encrypted information, so it does not expose the uesr.
