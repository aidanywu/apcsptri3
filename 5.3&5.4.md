## Github Pages Actions 5.3 & 5.4 

### 5.3
#### 1. The owner of the computer does not think it is intentional. This happened due to some mistake or ignorance in the hp computer's programming. It was harmful but it was not likely intended to be harmful. It should be corrected. We can include more diverse testing and thinking to produce a better outcome.


### 5.4
#### 1. An idea would be to have a survey on what features they would most like to see for everyone to fill out. This way, more people would be able to be interested in coding and the finished features.

#### 2. Yes, our project would be able to create more features that try to include eveyone which makes it better.

## 5.3 and 5.4 Notes

### Notes:
#### 5.3: Explicit data are those you intentionally give. Implicit data are those that are received without you giving them explicitly. Bias in algorithms and data can cause bias in computer innovations. Programmers should reduce bias. All softwares can be biased. Some bias are intentional while others are not. 

#### 5.4: Crowdsourcing allows you to share and obatin information, and also participate in distributed computing. Crypto-currencies and covid data all use crowdsourcing. APIâ€™s are used to obtain data from crowdsourcing.
