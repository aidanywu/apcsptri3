#### 2. The license I chose for my personal repository was the MIT license. This is beacuse it is open source where anyone can use my code but I also get credit for the work I did. The license for the team repository we chose was the GNU General Public License v3.0 because we didn't want people to be able to distribute closed source versions


### 5.6
#### 1. Full name, school name, description of ourselves, cookies, IP address, email address, date of birth, phone number.

#### 2. I think there are some PII that you absolutely cannot reveal, like social security number and credit credit number, while others are okay to reveal to some people, like email address, date of brith, phone number, full name, and such.

#### 3. Good passwords are hard to crack and bruteforce through while bad passwords are not. Good passwords should be at least a certain length and have a mix of lower case and upper case letters, and symbols. Another step used in authentication can be sending an email or text to confirm that it is you (2 factor authentication).

#### 4. Symmetric ecryption uses only one key while asymmetric ecryption uses a private key and a public key.

#### 5. Certbot

#### 6. There is no phishing scheme that I had to learn the hard way. Examples are discord nitros that has a fake link and after clicking it and doing something on the website, it sends the same link to everyone in your dms. Fake emails are a very well known way of phishing as well.

#### 5.6: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - Information specific to an individual, can be good or bad. Information online is hard to get rid of. Authentication (Passwords). Multi-Factor Authentication (Fingerprint, Physical Card, Link to Phone or Email). Virus - Duplicate themselves across systems. Malware - Infiltrate a system through impersonation (email, ‘friendly’ website), damaging the system after getting in. Encryption and Decryption Caesar Cipher Rumkin Tools ← This website is really cool, holding tons of different ways to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric Encryption - Public and Private key. Public key used to encrypt a message. Private key used to decrypt a message. Digital Certificates - public and private keys,but verified. Phishing - Trick the user into providing personal information, usually an email or ‘friendly’ website. Keylogger - Records user keystrokes in order to gain passwords or other confidential information. Rogue Access Point - Intercepting data across a network.



## Github Pages Actions 5.3 & 5.4 

### 5.3
#### 1. The owner of the computer does not think it is intentional. This happened due to some mistake or ignorance in the hp computer's programming. It was harmful but it was not likely intended to be harmful. It should be corrected. We can include more diverse testing and thinking to produce a better outcome.


### 5.4
#### 1. An idea would be to have a survey on what features they would most like to see for everyone to fill out. This way, more people would be able to be interested in coding and the finished features.

#### 2. Yes, our project would be able to create more features that try to include eveyone which makes it better.

## 5.3 and 5.4 Notes

### Notes:
#### 5.3: Explicit data are those you intentionally give. Implicit data are those that are received without you giving them explicitly. Bias in algorithms and data can cause bias in computer innovations. Programmers should reduce bias. All softwares can be biased. Some bias are intentional while others are not. 

#### 5.4: Crowdsourcing allows you to share and obatin information, and also participate in distributed computing. Crypto-currencies and covid data all use crowdsourcing. API’s are used to obtain data from crowdsourcing.

## Github Pages Actions 5.1 & 5.2 

### 5.1
#### 1. Beneficial: More opportunities and possibilities, convenience, productivity
#### Harmful: Neglect of health, socializing, and overreliance

#### 2. The pursuit of dopamine can negatively impact productivity and therefore success. For example, my desire to use my phone in class makes me not want to pay attention and at home, it makes me procrastinate.


### 5.2
#### 1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by being knowledgable about technology and having access to them.

#### 2. They can educate the nonempowered ones about technology. I could help people that runs into problems with their technology.

#### 3. There are paper and red tapes which stops people from becoming digitally empowered. Such barriers in Del Norte are the block on some connections. Examples elsewhere are any rules that deny people of their access of devices or the internet.

## 5.1 and 5.2 Notes

### Notes:
#### 5.1: Technology can be used in a variety of ways for good and bad. A key example is drones, which can be used for search and rescue, while also being used to stalk people. Dopamine can affect how we act and what we accomplish. We sometimes choose tasks that spark dopamine instead of actually important tasks. Automated phone trees are convenient but sometimes don't get the best results. Changing up the phone tree can accomplish more things. A phone tree is an example of if-else statements.

#### 5.2: The digital divide is a major issue in many places. Factors that create digital are money, location, or education. Digital fears ( cyberbullying, sexting, or student privacy) may be expanding and influencing the digital divide.
