#### 2. The license I chose for my personal repository was the MIT license. This is beacuse it is open source where anyone can use my code but I also get credit for the work I did. The license for the team repository we chose was the GNU General Public License v3.0 because we didn't want people to be able to distribute closed source versions


### 5.6
#### 1. Full name, school name, description of ourselves, cookies, IP address, email address, date of birth, phone number.

#### 2. I think there are some PII that you absolutely cannot reveal, like social security number and credit credit number, while others are okay to reveal to some people, like email address, date of brith, phone number, full name, and such.

#### 3. Good passwords are hard to crack and bruteforce through while bad passwords are not. Good passwords should be at least a certain length and have a mix of lower case and upper case letters, and symbols. Another step used in authentication can be sending an email or text to confirm that it is you (2 factor authentication).

#### 4. Symmetric ecryption uses only one key while asymmetric ecryption uses a private key and a public key.

#### 5. Certbot

#### 6. There is no phishing scheme that I had to learn the hard way. Examples are discord nitros that has a fake link and after clicking it and doing something on the website, it sends the same link to everyone in your dms. Fake emails are a very well known way of phishing as well.
